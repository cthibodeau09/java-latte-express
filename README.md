## Description
The webpage is supposed to contain a mulitple choice quiz. 
However, we were never taught anything like this and I was unable to complete the assignment as I would be plagarizing the entire assignment by getting examples from others just to piece it together. So the website contains my own HTML and CSS, with Javascript coding from an example on youtube which is cited below. I stopped putting the code in because I simply do not understand what I am even writing or why I am writing it, again never taught what we are supposed to be putting in THIS assignment. 

I had a tutor session but she cancelled on me because she was having technical difficulites and I was never able to reschedule as there were no time slots availabe. 

Feeling exteremly discouraged as I paid a lot of money for this course and feel that I have not been taught properly, in a way that I can understand or comprehend to apply to future assignments. Very dissapointed.
